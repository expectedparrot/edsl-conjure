The purpose of this research is to better understand perceptions toward conflict.



What the survey will ask you to do:       

 

We will first ask you a series of background questions. These will include questions about your age, gender, race, income, and education. At no point will you be asked any question which could personally identify you. Thus, we assure you that your responses will be anonymous and confidential. After these, we will ask you for brief responses to questions related to conflict. We estimate that this survey will take you about 7-10 minutes to complete. 



Risks and discomforts: 



We do not anticipate any risks from participating in this research.



Benefits:



There are no direct benefits to participating in the survey. Participants may gain some indirect benefits from greater engagement with important political and societal issues. Information from this study may benefit other people now or in the future by helping us better understand what and how people think about important policy and defense issues.



Privacy, confidentiality, and data security: 



All survey data is collected through an anonymous link from the survey research firm Qualtrics. No identifying information, including IP address or physical location, will be collected. We anticipate that your participation in this survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the Internet.



Sharing de-identified data collected in this research: 



De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community at large to advance science and health. To protect your privacy, we do not collect any personal information that could identify you. This is done to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share.



Taking part is voluntary: 



Your participation in this research is voluntary. You have the right to withdraw at any point during the study, for any reason and the data you have submitted to that point will be destroyed and not stored for use.

","This view space on the survey is only about a sentence long; Here's a summary I've added after writing: the ethical targeting process relies on LOAC, JWT/JWT (just war tradition/theory), ROE, and seeing civilian casualities as a rare part of warfare and not a daily, hourly regular part of warfare.  Your scenario given in this survey is a counterinsurgency scenario. Currently, in the Army, we are using large scale combat operations in five domains, called multi-domain or all domain (cyber, space, air, land, sea). Civilian casualties may be acceptable in counterinsurgency if the casualties are a result from terrorists conducting operations in areas or sites that lose protection if converted into an enemy weapons development factory (to include small suicide vest making, or IED making operations). The Joint and Allied Forces need to conduct positive identification processes and must use precision munitions with rounds or effects that are proportional to the needed effects. There are legal constraints to consider in this total ethical targeting process. The civilian casualties need to be shown to be relatively rare. See the movie Eye in the Sky to discuss the topic with focus groups. If one uses the Hamas Oct 7th attack on Kibbutzim and the music festival with widespread kidnapping, then legitimate targeting must go after the terrorists. Hopefully the AI that analyzes this writing will be able to put it in a readable summary. If you aren't using some AI support, I recommend it.

-who is gathering the intel/data, who is interpreting the data, what system/matrix/worldview/ethical principles of the person interpreting the data and the same for the person(s) who develop the criteria/system for analyzing intel/data and teaching that criteria/system to those that will use it.
-does someone have real time and in-person human visibility on the target (not just an audio/visual feed from a drone or some other electronic observation tool)
-I then wondered if there is a difference between a drone employing a weapon system by a person thousands of miles away and a pilot employing a weapon system from thousands of feet away (what difference does distance make in the decision making process) if there are not people on the ground that can provide information on a target in order to inform a commander.
-I also wondered how likely/unlikely any weapons system is to inflict loss/damage greater than the intended target (to include the loss of non-combatant/civilians/non-combat infrastructure)
-I also considered that although this particular resource/tool available to a commander was considered ""legal"", that does not mean that it is moral or ethical.

As a result, I see that drones are just one tool/resource or a weapon system available for a commander to choose from. It may be ""legal"", but whether or not it is moral or ethical is influenced by some of the factors I mentioned above. The declaration of ""legal"" does not protect commanders and operators of weapon systems of moral injury when things go wrong or more information is available after the fact. Nor does it protect non-combatants who are affected by the weapon system. 
Ultimately, the legitimacy, or lack thereof, is eroded because commanders are not equipped/trained on the difference between something being legal, moral, and/or ethical and that something could possibly be only one or two of these things not all three.

- Personnel experience in Intelligence community requiring legitimacy.","JUS IN BELLO principles—principles for restraining the use of force in a war. The discrimination principle (a) The idea is that nothing justifies indiscriminate slaughter (b) Plato was the first to articulate a version of this principle in stating that: •	In any conflict, the whole population consisting of men, women and children are not the enemy •	Those truly responsible for war are always only a few leaders •	So, Plato urged that a distinction be made between the guilty (those responsible for the quarrel) and the innocent (those not responsible for it) •	In the course of conflict, soldiers should do no violence to the innocent and focus their military operations only on the guilty (c) The principle was developed in its traditional form by Thomas Aquinas in the 13th c. A.D. •	The traditional form of the discrimination principle requires that a distinction must be maintained between combatants and noncombatants (as opposed to the guilty and innocent) •	Although noncombatants may lose their lives or suffer, as a result of military action, there must be no direct intention to take noncombatant lives by attacking nonmilitary targets •	Thomas Aquinas expanded the principle further by also making a distinction between intended and unintended effects •	For Aquinas, while one must never willfully intend to threaten noncombatant lives, it is always possible in a war that noncombatants might be killed unintentionally as collateral damage and this possibility does not by itself make the means of fighting a war immoral. The avoidance of evil means principles well. The right spirit as well as probability of success could apply.
